## Features

Be cool, generally

## Dependencies

### Required
These components are required for the mod to function and are bundled as part of any download:
* [HarmonyKSP](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/HarmonyKSP)

## Installation

To install, place the GameData folder inside your Kerbal Space Program folder. If asked to overwrite files, please do so.

NOTE: Do NOT rename or move folders within the GameData folder - this mod uses absolute paths to assets and will break if this happens.

## Contributing

I certainly accept pull requests. Please target all such things to the `dev` branch though!
