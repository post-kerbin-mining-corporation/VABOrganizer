## Features

Be cool, generally

## Dependencies

### Required
These components are required for the mod to function and are bundled as part of any download:
* [HarmonyKSP](https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/HarmonyKSP)

## Installation

To install, place the GameData folder inside your Kerbal Space Program folder. If asked to overwrite files, please do so.

NOTE: Do NOT rename or move folders within the GameData folder - this mod uses absolute paths to assets and will break if this happens.

## Contributing

I certainly accept pull requests. Please target all such things to the `dev` branch though!

Currently, subcategories can use any/all of the following ways to define parts to include.
```
ORGANIZERSUBCATEGORY
{
  name = pods
  Label = Pods
  // part names to include. This is an exact match against the part name. 
  part = cupola
  part = landerCabinSmall
}
ORGANIZERSUBCATEGORY
{
  name = landers
  Label = Landers + Probes
  // part names to include. this is a regex mach against the part name
  regex = probe
  regex = lander
}
ORGANIZERSUBCATEGORY
{
  name = probes
  Label = Probes
  // paths to include. this is a regex mach against the PartURL variable
  path = Squad/Parts/Command/mk1Cockpits
  path = Squad/Parts/Command/MpoProbe
}
```
